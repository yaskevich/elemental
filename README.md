### Preprocessing

- Create SQLite database file with the structure as it is in `text2db.py`
- Run:

```
python text2db.py file.txt
```

#### Requirements 

NodeJS

#### Running the application

`npm install`

`node index.js`

Obviously, in production one should not use bare node instance, but some manager, such as PM2.
